/* This hides the title on the homepage.

   It's kind of a hack because it relies on the post ID, so someday when
   someone comes along and wants to change up the homepage, they'll create a
   new page, set it as the "primary page" or whatever wordpress calls it, and
   be greatly confused as to why the new page suddenly has a title.

   Does that mean I have a better way to do this? No.
